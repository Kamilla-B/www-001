        <h1 class="w3-text-blue">History Of Buryatia</h1>
        <h2 class="w3-text-indigo">Who are Buryats?</h2>
        <p>Early History and Mongol Influence The territory of Buryatia has a long and rich history, with evidence of
            human habitation dating back to the Paleolithic era. The ancestors of the modern Buryats were
            Mongolic-speaking tribes who inhabited the region around Lake Baikal. In the 13th century, the Buryat lands
            came under the influence of the Mongol Empire, founded by Genghis Khan. The Buryats were incorporated into
            the Mongol Yuan Dynasty and later became part of the Northern Yuan Dynasty after the collapse of the Mongol
            Empire in 1368. Russian Expansion and Incorporation In the 17th century, the Russian Empire began its
            expansion eastward into Siberia. Russian explorers and traders reached the Buryat lands, and in 1666, the
            first Russian fort was established in the region. Over the next century, the Russian Empire gradually
            asserted its control over Buryatia, culminating in the treaties of Nerchinsk (1689) and Kyakhta (1727),
            which formally delineated the border between Russia and the Qing Dynasty (which then ruled Mongolia). Buryat
            Culture and Identity Despite Russian colonization, the Buryats managed to maintain their unique cultural
            identity. They preserved their language, traditions, and Buddhist faith, which had been introduced from
            Tibet in the 17th century. The Buryats also developed a written script based on the Mongolian alphabet. In
            the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a Buryat intellectual movement emerged, advocating for greater
            autonomy and the preservation of Buryat culture. Soviet Period and Autonomy After the Russian Revolution of
            1917, Buryatia became an autonomous region within the Soviet Union. In 1923, the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous
            Soviet Socialist Republic (Buryat-Mongol ASSR) was established, uniting several Buryat-populated areas.
            During the Soviet era, Buryatia experienced significant economic and social development, but also suffered
            from political repression and forced collectivization. Modern Buryatia In 1990, Buryatia declared its
            sovereignty and became the Republic of Buryatia within the Russian Federation. Today, Buryatia is a
            multi-ethnic republic with a diverse economy based on agriculture, industry, and tourism. The republic is
            also a center of Buddhist culture in Russia, with numerous monasteries and temples. The Buryats continue to
            play an active role in the cultural and political life of the republic, striving to preserve their unique
            heritage and identity.</p>
